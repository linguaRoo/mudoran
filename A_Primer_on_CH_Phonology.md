*The following introduction will have technical linguistic terminology in it. If you prefer, skip down to the* **Pronunciation Guide** *section below, which teaches how to make the sounds in this conlang in an accessible, non-technical way.*

The Classical Hylian **(CH)** constructed language has, in its standardized dialectal form, a total of thirty-six phonemes (twenty-four consonants and twelve vowels). A phoneme is a recognized speech sound that has meaning. For example, in English, *pat* and *bat* have different meanings, and the only difference between them is their initial sounds. Therefore, the /p/ and /b/ are phonemes. In Japanese, on the other hand, the /r/ and /l/ sounds don't change the meaning if one is substituted for the other, so they are not separate phonemes.

Any native speaker of a language will have their perception of foreign sounds colored by the sounds they're familiar with. A native Japanese speaker's ear will perceive /l/ as a "kind of /r/-sound" rather than a distinctive and separate sound. French has two different high, round vowels; /y/ made in the front of the mouth and /u/ in the back. English has only one. An English speaker will tend to hear both as variants of the "oo" in *food*. But to a Francophone ear, they sound nothing alike.

***Consonants***
Most of the twenty-four consonant phonemes found in **CH** also exist in English, or in languages commonly encountered by English speakers. In the standard pronunciation used in-world by educated, urban speakers in Castletown, they are as follows. Sounds in parentheses are allophones and/or dialect-dependent.

|                 | Bilabial | Dental | Alveolar | Pstalv./Palatal   | Velar | Glottal |
| --------------- | -------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------- | ----- | ------- |
| Nasal           | m        | n      |          | ɲ                 | (ŋ)   | (ʔ)     |
| Stop            | p b      | t d    |          |                   | k g   |         |
| Fricative       | ɸ β      | (θ ð)  | s z      | ʃ ʒ (ɕ ʑ)         | (x)   | h       |
| Affricate       |          |        | t͡s      | t͡ʃ d͡ʒ (t͡ɕ d͡ʑ) |       |         |
| Central approx. |          |        | (ɹ)      | j                 | w     |         |
| Lateral approx. |          | l      |          | ʎ                 |       |         |
| Flap/tap        |          |        | ɾ        |                   |       |         |
I know what you're thinking: those words are big, scary, and sound very technical. Allow me to explain. The top row of the table lists what are known as **places of articulation**, which is where in the mouth the sound is made. The leftmost column lists **manners of articulation**, or differing ways by which the airflow through the vocal tract is blocked to produce a sound.

The places of articulation mentioned above are:

**Bilabial**
> Both lips come together to make the sound. 

**Dental**
> The tongue tip or blade touches the teeth.

**Alveolar**
> The tongue tip or blade touches the ridge behind the top teeth.

**Postalveolar and palatal**
> The front part of the tongue approaches or contacts the back of the alveolar ridge and/or the hard palate (the roof of the mouth).

**Velar**
> The back part of the tongue approaches or contacts the velum or soft palate, located behind the hard palate.

**Glottal**
> The sound is made in the voice box, by the vocal chords themselves.

The manners of articulation are:

**Nasal**
> The articulators (lips or tongue) block the air flow through the mouth, forcing it to come out the nose.

**Stop (or plosive)**
> The airflow is blocked and released abruptly, creating a short, sharp sound.

**Fricative**
>The airflow is nearly blocked and becomes turbulent at the place of articulation, causing an "airy" or "hissing" sound. The "hissing" types are also called "sibilant" sounds.

**Affricate**
> A quick sequence of a stop and a fricative. The airstream is blocked and then released less abruptly than a stop, causing the air to escape noisily.

**Central approximant**
> The articulator approaches the place of articulation but is more open than for a fricative, and there is no audible friction. 

**Lateral approximant**
> Like the central approximant except the airflow is allowed to escape around the sides of the tongue instead of the center.

**Flap/tap**
> These terms are generally seen as interchangeable. The articulator strikes the point of contact very briefly.

In short, having our lungs connected to our food-holes gave us an incredible gift to make various noises we string together in ways that we assign meaning.

***Vowels***
Depending on dialect, there are twelve, or sometimes eleven, vowel phonemes in **CH** comprising five to six monophthongs and six diphthongs. Aside from /æ/, which is in the process of merging with /e/, each of the monophthongs change quality depending on whether they are stressed or unstressed. Parentheses indicate the *unstressed* allophones of each vowel.

|            | Front | Central | Back    |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Close      | i     |         | u       |
| Near-close | (ɪ)   |         | (ʊ~ɯ̽ᵝ) |
| Close-mid  | e     |         | o       |
| Mid        |       | (ə~ɐ)   |         |
| Open-mid   | (ɛ)   |         | (ɔ)     |
| Open       | æ~ɛˑ  | a       |         |
Vowels can be defined by their **backness** and their **openness or height**. 

Backness refers to where the tongue body sits during the production of the vowel:

**Front**
> The tongue body is held forward in the mouth, somewhere in the palatal region, when the vowel is spoken. The lips tend to also be spread, as if smiling.

**Central**
> The tongue body is in between the front and back positions. The lips are generally relaxed.

**Back**
> The tongue body is held back in the mouth, somewhere in the velar, uvular, or pharyngeal region, when the vowel is spoken. The lips tend to also be rounded.

Openness is how much the jaw is opened and how low the tongue is kept when the vowel is spoken:

**Close**
> The tongue is raised high in the mouth and the jaw is nearly closed. The lips are usually either spread wide or tightly rounded. If the tongue is a bit less tense, it is termed near-close.

**Mid**
> The tongue and jaw are midway between the close and open positions. Slightly higher than mid is termed close-mid, and slightly lower is termed open-mid. The lips can be doing almost anything.

**Open**
> The tongue is depressed almost as far as it will go, and the jaw is wide open. The lips are usually relaxed, as it is difficult to spread or round them when the jaw is this low. If the tongue is not pressed down as tensely, it is termed near-open.


There are six diphthongs as follows. All are closing, that is, the first vowel is the more prominent of the two. "What the deuce is a diphthong?" you may be asking. Think of it as two vowel sounds that run into each other. A pure vowel sound is a monophthong, or "single sound".

|       | i   | u   |
| ----- | --- | --- |
| **i** |     | iu  |
| **e** | ei  |     |
| **a** | ai  | au  |
| **o** | oi  |     |
| **u** | ui  |     |

***Romanization***
The official romanization convention for CH is to represent these sounds in terms of their closest equivalents in common real-world languages. For example /ɸ β/ are written \<f> and \<v> respectively, although they aren't quite the same as how these sounds are made in English. Below is a guide to two romanization conventions recommended by the HLS for writing CH text. We'll be using the first one throughout this course, but the other is acceptable if a learner prefers diacritics to digraphs.

If a learner wants to use some other system of their own choice to write these sounds, they should feel free to do so, as long as it's consistent and understandable.

***Pronunciation Guide***
Here's a layperson's guide to every phoneme in **CH**.

**M** /m/ 
> Like the *m* in 'mother'.

**N** /n/
> Like the *n* in 'night', but with the tongue tip touching the top teeth.

**NY** /ɲ/ 
> Similar to the *ny* in 'canyon', or Spanish *año* (year).

**P** /p/
> Like the *p* in 'play', with a puff of air at the start of words. At the end of a word, it may be unreleased.

**B** /b/
> Like the *b* in 'boy'. At the end of a word, it is very weak and may be unreleased.

**T** /t/
> Like the *t* in 'table', but with the tongue tip touching the top teeth. Pronounce it with a puff of air when it begins a word. At the end of a word, it may be unreleased.

**D** /d/
> Like the *d* in 'dog', but with the tongue tip touching the top teeth. It is very weak word-finally and may be unreleased.

**K** /k/
> Like the *k* in 'kite'. Pronounce it with a puff of air at the start of a word. At the end of a word, it may be unreleased.

**G** /g/
> Like the *g* in 'garden'. It is always hard, **never** soft like in 'gem'; that sound would be spelled *j* in **CH**. At the end of a word, it usually weakens to an *ng* as in *sing*.

**F** /ɸ/
> Not quite like the English *f*. The lips come together without touching the teeth, the way you'd blow out a candle.

**V** /β/
> Like the above sound, but with voice. Try to say a *v* without biting your lip. In Spanish, *b* and *v* both make this sound between vowels.

**S** /s/
> Like the *s* in 'sand'. The tongue should be flat, with the blade against the ridge behind your top teeth, and the tongue tip may be hanging slightly down.

**Z** /z/
> Like the *z* in...you guessed it, 'Zelda'! Same as the *s* but voiced.

**SH** /ʃ/
> More or less like the *sh* in 'ship', but don't stick your lips out. The tongue tip should be behind the lower teeth and the lips neutral or slightly spread. 

**ZH** /ʒ/
> Like in 'vision', or a French *j* as in *jeune* (young), but avoid pushing your lips out. Same as the *sh* but voiced.

**H** /h/
> Like the *h* in 'hall'. Between vowels it is weaker and may be lost in less careful speech. After a consonant (and sometimes initially, in emphatic speech) it's a stronger, throatier sound, similar to the *ch* in 'loch'; before /i/ it makes a hissy sound like German *ich*.


**TS** /t͡s/
> Like the sound at the end of *cats*, or the initial sound in the proper Japanese pronunciation of *tsunami*. This sound, unlike in English, occurs at the start of syllables in **CH**.

**CH** /t͡ʃ/
> More or less like the *ch* in 'chip', but as with *sh* and *zh*, make sure the lips don't stick out, and keep the tongue tip down.

**J** /d͡ʒ/
> Like the *j* in 'jump'. Never like the *j* of French *jour* (day) - that's *zh*. As with *ch*, mind the lip shape and position of the tongue tip.

**Y** /j/
> Not to be confused with the *j* above, the IPA symbol /j/ is spelled with a *y* in English, as in 'yes'. The same is true for **CH**.

**W** /w/
> Like the *w* in 'wood'. The tongue bunches up in the back of the mouth, and the lips are tightly rounded.

**L** /l/
> Like the *l* in 'leaf', but be careful. In English, the /l/ sound tends to have a "dark" or throaty quality where the sound resonates farther back in the mouth. The **CH** /l/ is always front and light, with the tongue tip on or just behind the top teeth.

**LY** /ʎ/
> This sound doesn't have an exact English equivalent, but the *ll* in 'million' is close. It exists in Italian, where it's spelled *gl*, and in Portuguese, where it's spelled *lh*. The middle of the tongue touches the palate as for *y*, but the air is allowed to escape around the sides.

**R** /ɾ/
> This sound is a little trickier. In the middle of a word, it is a tap of the tongue against the ridge right behind your teeth. If you speak Spanish, Japanese, or Turkish, you can make this sound. At the start of a word, it sounds like the English liquid *r* as in 'red', but without rounding of the lips. Finally, at the end of a word, it is devoiced, which can sound a bit like *sh* to the untrained ear.

And onward to the vowels...

**A** /a/ (stressed); /ə~ɐ/ (unstressed)
> When stressed it's like the *a* of 'father' but not quite as far back in the mouth. When unstressed it reduces to a schwa, or "uh" sound, as in 'about'.

**AE** /æ~ɛˑ/ 
> This is the odd vowel out. In an earlier stage of **CH**, it was /æ/ (as in 'bad') when stressed and /ɛ/ (as in 'bet') when unstressed. In the state of the language as of the events of *Ocarina of Time*, it is usually pronounced as an in-between sound /ɛˑ/ that may or may not shorten when unstressed. This is a slightly longer "eh" vowel, as in the start of the name 'Ellen'.

**E** /e/ (stressed and open syllable); /ɛ/ (elsewhere)
> When stressed and in an open syllable, it's like the vowel in 'play' without the glide, or in French *clé* (key). If the syllable is closed and/or unstressed, it is like the vowel in *bet*, or like *ae* above but shorter.

**I** /i/ (stressed); /ɪ/ (unstressed)
>When stressed it's like the *i* in 'machine', or a double *ee* as in 'cheese'. The tongue is high and the lips spread wide. When unstressed it's like the *i* in 'kid' instead.

**O** /o/ (stressed and open syllable); /ɔ/ (elsewhere)
> English is very bad about putting a glide on the *o* sound. When stressed and in an open syllable, it's like the vowel of 'goat' but with no glide. It may help to imitate a Scottish accent. It's fairly closed, and the lips should be nice and round. Elsewhere, it's similar to the vowel in 'caught' (if your dialect hasn't merged it with 'cot'). The tongue is lower, and the lips are both round and open.

**U** /u/ (stressed); /ʊ~ɯ̽ᵝ/ (unstressed)
> When stressed, it's like the double *oo* in 'food', or the *u* in Spanish or Italian. The tongue is high and the lips very round. When unstressed, it's like the double *oo* in 'hook' instead, and may be only slightly rounded.

**AI** /ai/
> This diphthong sounds similar to the vowel sound in 'ice'.

**EI** /ei/
> An /e/ run into an /i/. Like the vowel sound in 'play'.

**OI** /oi/
> Like in 'coin'.

**AU** /au/
> Like in 'cow', or when you stub your toe and say "ow!"

**IU** /iu/
> No standard English equivalent to this one, but it's similar to what you might say when you're disgusted by something. "Ewww!"

**UI** /ui/
> The reverse of /iu/ above. It's not "whee!" but more like in 'gooey', as one syllable.
