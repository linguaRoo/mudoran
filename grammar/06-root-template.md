# Consonantal Roots & Vowel Templates
Mudoran is a root & template language, which means that the underlying word stems for further development can all be formed by combining a **root** (usually 3 unique consonants) with a **template** (usually 2-4 vowels). Of these elements, roots are represented in \<angle brackets>, and templates are represented in \{curly braces}.

Roots can be referred to by the name of a significant person or concept associated with them, such as a deity, a group of Hylian people, or a concept. These terms are modern inventions, and by no means do we believe they were a historical part of discussing these terms, if indeed Mudorans ever *did* discuss linguistics.

We'll start with the **Din** root, \<\*tnr${_2}$>, to explore how this system works.

## Roots
Roots are not words, but rather a semantic space of shared and related meaning. Many modern words derive from the same root, and the further a language moves from the time of Mudoran, the more pronounced these sound changes can become. Most roots can, however, be boiled down to a maximum of four primary areas, which are listed in the root list as different senses.

The **Din** root, \<\*tnr${_2}$> represents the element of earth, the element of fire, and the abstract concepts of power and danger.

> \<\***tnr${_2}$**> 1. fire, burning 2. earth, supporting 3. power, ruling 4. danger, struggling

Other roots have similar ranges of meanings, some staying much closer to a single core concept, while others spread further afield.

## Templates
A root isn't a word -- to become a word, it must be brought together with something else, a **template** which is composed of several vowels and slots for the letters of a root to fit into. Now, it should be noted that we call these *vowel templates*, but they can actually contain a few consonants as well -- these consonants are called *nuclear* or *syllabic* consonants.

A template takes the form of \<\*1a2iu3i> "class 1 noun," where the numerals 1, 2, 3 represent the positions where the consonants are placed into the template. Despite the sample provided here, there is no requirement that there be any vowels between two consonants, this is only a way to introduce the concept.

> \***taniur${_2}$i** (class 1 noun) fire, heat
> \***taniur${_2}$aː** (class 2 noun) earth, land, continent
> \***tonr${_2}$iː** (class 3 noun) power, might, strength
> \***tonar${_2}$ai** (class 4 noun) danger, struggle, suffering

This introduces the basic noun templates:

- \<\***1a2iu3i**> class one noun; a noun from the first conceptual space of the root.
- \<\***1a2iu3aː**> class two noun; a noun from the second conceptual space of the root
- \<\***1o23iː**> class three noun; a noun from the third conceptual space of the root
- \<\***1o2a3ai**> class four noun; a noun from the fourth conceptual space of the root

### Advanced Templates 1
Templates can be explained simply as a set of vowels with spaces defined for the consonants to be placed into, but this is only the simplest form of template available in Mudoran. We will discuss other templates as they become more relevant, but to begin with, be aware that Mudoran roots must always be unique sequences of consonants, and it's possible for a template to insert the same consonant multiple times, as in this example:

> \<\***1a1o23u**> (class 3 adjective)
> \***tatonr${_3}$u** (class 3 adjective) powerful, mighty, strong

## Conclusion
Now that we've covered the basics of the root and template system, we will introduce new templates in the following sections as they become relevant. Now that we've got phonology and the basic stem-formation system, we can get into the practical parts of the language, starting with... verbs.
