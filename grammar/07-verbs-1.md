# Basic Verbs in Mudoran
In this section, we're going to examine just two types of verbs, each of which has its own set of templates: **Copular** verbs are verbs that establish a state or quality, and are equivalent to English constructions like "*is running*." **Present tense** verbs are the simplest form of verbs, because you can learn them as a template, and they don't experience any other changes.

## Copular Verbs
Copular verbs take their tense from context, and are the simplest verbs to learn. For the sake of this lesson, we'll sample our copular verbs with the *tairag* root, \<\***tr${_1}$ʔ**>, because *tairag* is the copular verb in Neo-Modern Hylian.

> **tr${_1}$ʔ** 1. copula, fact 2. real, actual, existing 3. knowledge, information, knowing 4. instinct, belief, feeling

| Class | Template              | Sample Root         | Sample Word                         |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1     | \{\***1u2a3**}        | \<\***tr${_1}$ʔ**\> | \***tu\~aʔ** "is, am, being"        |
| 2     | \{\***1u2iː3**}       | \<\***tr${_1}$ʔ**\> | \***tu\~iːʔ** "existing"            |
| 3     | \{\***1r${_3}$u2o3**} | \<\***tr${_1}$ʔ**\> | \***t\^u\~oʔ** "knowing"            |
| 4     | \{\***a1u23iː**}      | \<\***tr${_1}$ʔ**\> | \***atu\~ʔiː** "feeling, believing" |
Note that all of these are things one can be said to **be**, to **be doing**, or to **experience** -- based on the four classes of **tr${_1}$ʔ**. We are using this root so we can look at the concept of copular verbs easily, but all other copular verbs can be said to be a state or concept of being, existing as, knowing, or feeling whatever their verb is.

Once we have formed our basic verbs, we also need to inflect them in three other ways: For gender (Din, Nayru, Farore), for number (singular, plural, collective), and for tense. From what we have reconstructed, gender and number are formed primarily by ablaut -- that is to say by changing or adding elements to the vowel template, while tense is formed by a prefix or suffix depending on the class.

To start with, we'll focus on our Class 1 verb inflected for gender and number.

| Goddess | Singular | Plural | Collective |
| ------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Din     |          |        |            |
| Nayru   |          |        |            |
| Farore  |          |        |            |
We should probably explore what each gender represents to understand this better.

### Din Gender
Din gender refers to active things, unliving things about and from the land, and to abstractions of power, might, violence, and cooking. Other common themes in this gender include tools, weapons, and men or "masculine" things. In some descendants of Mudoran, this gender becomes coded to to colour and name Red.

### Nayru Gender
Nayru gender refers to passive things, unliving things about and from the waters, and to abstractions of wisdom, knowledge, peace, and language. Other common themes in this gender include the practical arts and sciences, architecture, and women or "feminine" things. In some descendants of Mudoran, this gender becomes coded to the colour and name Blue.

### Farore Gender
Farore genders refers to growing things, living things of all sorts not belonging to the other genders, and to abstractions of life, growth, decline, and death in all of their forms. Other commons themes in this gender include recreation and all arts outside of those associated with crafting or practical uses, spirits and spirituality, and balance between opposing or contrasting forces. In some descendants of Mudoran, this gender becomes coded to the colour and name Green.
