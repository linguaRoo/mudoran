This project is published in a GitHub repository containing UTF-8 text files, primarily formatted using [Obsidian]()-formatted [Markdown]() files with a .md extension. There may be future publications in other formats, such as a compiled Google Doc, ODT, or even a fully compiled and rendered PDF. We use a hierarchical file structure, with most of our documentation kept in a well-sorted tree, with well-sorted contents in most of our files.

In addition to normal tables which we use for simple tabular data, we also use a custom table format which allows for spanned cells across both columns and rows -- this is not a Markdown standard, but these tables are stored in individual files separate from the main text. These tables are called [WIPE Tables](_meta/wipe_tables), a format created by Ostin specifically for the sake of a table format with simple spanning.
