# Front Matter

This is a conlang inspired by *The Legend of Zelda* series, and the world it presents.

I have been inspired by many previous Zelda conlangers, and this project attempts to make an ancient, ancestral language from which myself and future conlangers might be able to derive new Zelda languages. I informally started this project in October 2023, and formally started it in November 2023, but the first draft of documentation here is not expected to be published until mid-2024: If you are reading this in June or July, I met my goal for a first release!

I have been inspired by many Hylian (and other Zelda-related) languages in my goal of creating Mudoran. The biggest influence to me is [Kasuto of Kataan](https://kasuto.net) and his Modern Hylian language (of which I maintain a revitalized branch), though I have also been inspired by projects such as [Sarinilli](https://www.deviantart.com/sarinilli)'s Hylian, [Istana-hutan](http://www.notesdevoyage.com/)'s Hylian language, [koallary]()'s Zonai, and [Taerelon]()'s Classical Hylian. I have likely been inspired by other languages, and I apologize for not mentioning them all here.

The concept of **Mudoran** is to be the last universal linguistic ancestor of the languages which would be spoken within the games. This language would exist in a time before the gameplay of *Skyward Sword*, and possibly even before the Era of Hylia in the backstory of that game. Mudoran forms stem words from consonantal roots -- usually 3 consonants -- and plugging in a variety of derivational vowel templates. These stem words are then mutated to form a wider variety of words.

Great thanks to the members of the **Hylian Linguistic Society** for offering input and feedback on the project.
