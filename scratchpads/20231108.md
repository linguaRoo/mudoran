## Structure of the Day: Inverted Verb Template

Some verbs can have their directionality inverted by reversing the verb template in a repetition of the verb, for example **tuwa'-tawu'** would be something akin to "being different," or "being uneven." In the context of today's words of the day, however, we can complete the iconic saying we began on the first:

> **uhjara tuwa' aadonri tuwat**
> "*Being alone is dangerous.*"

> **aazotwi tukiow-tiokuw**
> "*Take (this) weapon*."
