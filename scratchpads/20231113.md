## Mudoran WotD for 2023-Nov-13

### Roots
- **thm** _root._ 1. ten 2. thread, string, rope 3. connected, bound 4. to treat as one
### Templates
- **ii+a++u** _template._ 1. compound number, tens counter
- **iu+a++i** _template._ 1. compound number, ones counter
### Words
- **tiiham** _numeral._ 1. ten
- **iihajru iuhajri** _numeral._ 1. eleven; literally "one ten and one"
## On Compound Numbers    

for values from 11-19, the **compound number ones counter** _can_ be used alone to indicate the number -- **iuhajri** doesn't require **iihajru** to mean "11" as the use of the ones counter form implies at least one ten

but in formal Mudoran, one would be expected to use the full term

**iidahmu** (ten tens) on the other hand is normally used for the precise value of one hundred, and as the prefix up to 109. The counting template for hundreds is not yet defined.
